    I'm a polyglot programmer and a bit of a jack-of-all-trades. I've done lots and lots of
    backend and frontend web server programming in Java, Scala, Elixir and Python.
    Additionally I've done worked on "big data" pipelines, Android apps, and Unity games.
    I also know enough Javascript to know how to get things done, how to avoid the pitfalls
    and to know I don't love it.
